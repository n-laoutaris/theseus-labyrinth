# Minimal walking simulator with Unity

A mini Unity project created in **one sitting** as a quick prototype for a colleague's dissertation â€” used as an interactive storytelling medium. Now showcased here as an example of how easy it is to create a functional first-person 3D walking simulator using Unity, free assets, and a single script.

## Play the Game

Try it out on [Unity Play](https://play.unity.com/en/games/86aa24a4-12c2-4350-9c38-be35adc5188c/theseus-labyrinth)  

## What's Inside?

This mini-project is intentionally minimalist and uses only built-in Unity features and a few free resources:

- A simple 3D labyrinth scene made of geometric primitives (cubes and planes)
- A first-person controller built from scratch using just one C# script
- Materials for the walls and floor
- A skybox image to enhance visual atmosphere
- A single directional light for global illumination
- All physics, collisions, and lighting are handled by Unity URP (built-in renderer)

## Features

- Smooth first-person camera and movement
- Ambient lighting and materials for visual appeal
- Fully playable in-browser or as a desktop build
- Ultra-simple structure: _just one script and one scene_

## To be added

A full build of the project is pending upload. Feel free to use the Unity Play preview until then.
